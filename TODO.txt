A rough plan
============


must haves for basic usability
------------------------------

- show a clock NEXT


must haves for person other than me usability
---------------------------------------------

- button for advance clock
- means of control other than random keybindings
      - buttons for climb/cruise/descent
- a landing page to select:
    - start pos & heading
    - aircraft type
    - wind / random wind


basic prog improvements
-----------------------

- logging


figure out how to go forward
----------------------------

- multi-plane & plane specific data on the websocket; how to do with json &
  types?


bugs
----

- if you time-step with a big number (10 hours) you end up at an invalid
  position
